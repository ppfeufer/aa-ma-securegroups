## What's the difference to Member Audit Securegroups<a name="whats-the-difference-to-member-audit-securegroups"></a>

Pretty much nothing.

I took over Member Audit Securegroups in August 2022 from the original developer who
is no longer actively maintaining the app. After more than a year and the fact that
I have a distinct dislike for Gitlab, and the original developer didn't want to transfer
the PyPi repository to me, I decided it is time to make an actual fork of the app
which is now again actively maintained by me.

This app is fully compatible with the original, all that has changed is the `pip`
name from `aa-memberaudit-securegroups` to `aa-ma-securegroups`, and if
you had the original app installed, it is really easy to switch to this one, see
[Step 0.5: Migrating from Member Audit Securegroups](#step-05-migrating-from-member-audit-securegroups).

Thanks to [@rcmurphy](https://github.com/rcmurphy) for all her work on the [original
app](https://gitlab.com/eclipse-expeditions/aa-memberaudit-securegroups)!

### Requirements<a name="requirements"></a>

This integration needs [Member Audit](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-memberaudit)
and [Secure Groups](https://github.com/pvyParts/allianceauth-secure-groups) to
function. Please make sure they are installed before continuing.

### Step 0.5: Migrating from Member Audit Securegroups<a name="step-05-migrating-from-member-audit-securegroups"></a>

In case you have the original app installed, you need to uninstall it before
you can continue. To do so, simply run:

```shell
pip uninstall aa-memberaudit-securegroups
```

That's all, no need to worry about the DB related stuff, this app is fully
compatible with it and will use the DB tables from the original app. Now feel free
to continue with the installation.

### Step 1: Install the Package<a name="step-1-install-the-package"></a>

Make sure you are in the virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth
installation. Then install the newest release from PyPI:

```shell
pip install aa-ma-securegroups
```

### Step 2: Config<a name="step-2-config"></a>

Add `memberaudit_securegroups` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.

### Step 3: Finalize App Installation<a name="step-3-finalize-app-installation"></a>

Run migrations:

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

Restart your supervisor services for Auth
